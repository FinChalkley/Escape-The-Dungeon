# Escape-The-Dungeon
Redesign of my final year uni project. The original project --> https://github.com/FinChalkley/final-year-project
The aim of this was to make a better level generation where the level did not feel so homoginus and an grid-based inventory system. 

The privious level generation was very clunky and worked by rotating small premade rooms so that doorways could line up with each other. This lead to a less than ideal level that felt overly camped and with very little explorivity. The new generation now focuses on larger permade rooms and replacing one of the pannels at the edge of the room with a doorway that corrisponds to the room to the side of it.

The privious inventory system used a collection of multiple images stored in a grid layout component that caused problems when storing items over multiple cells with the items only assecible in one cell and overlapping issues with the images.
